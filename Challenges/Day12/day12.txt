You're in the middle of probing a criminal group's mobile phones. But here's the twist: their messages are all scrambled up, like a secret code. It's like they're talking in a language only they understand. Your job just got tougher as you try to crack these encrypted messages and figure out what they're up to. You stumble upon a puzzling clue: a series of numbers and symbols  999|666|88|333|666|88|66|3|444|8 . It's like a secret code they've left behind. What could it mean? Note:Symbols are inconsequential; their purpose is to make numbers separate. And submit as flag{decrypted_text}
