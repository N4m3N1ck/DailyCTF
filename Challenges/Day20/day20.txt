Challenge description:
Housed within the pixels of a single image is the mysterious "Crypto Palace". Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to reveal the villa's location

For example, the latitude is 37.123456789012345, and the longitude is 45.987654321098765.

Then use these coordinates to create the flag in the following format:

ZCTF{37.123456789012345, 45.987654321098765}
