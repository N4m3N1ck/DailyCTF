We can create this reverse of the function:
def reverse(m,k):
	x = ""
	for i in range(len(m)):
		x+=chr(ord(m[i])-ord(k[i])+69)
	return x
Now all we need to do is to find the correct key. We can loop through the passwords in rockyou.txt and find that when we use password123, we get a correct flag format flag{r0ckU}
